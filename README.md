Are you or someone you know struggling with a pet and considering sending them back to the shelter? Instead of contributing to the overcrowding of local shelters or humane societies, consider Fur-Ever-Home as a compassionate alternative. Fur-Ever-Home is a user-friendly and transparent platform that connects pet owners with interested and experienced adopters who can provide the care these pets need. Owners can create, view, edit, and delete pet listings, while adopters can browse available pets, gain comprehensive information, and directly contact owners.

## Pet Posts
On the available pets page, users can browse through the list of pet postings. Users can scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the next page to see more listings. There are filters for species, age, and specific search terms related to the pets, such as behavioral challenges, medical conditions, or keywords relating to their situations.

## Pet Details
When users click on a pet post, they are taken to the pet details page, which provides key information for each pet, such as their age, species, breed, behavioral issues, medical condition, and reason for rehoming. Each pet listing is connected to the owner's profile, featuring a "Contact Owner" button for direct communication.

## User Authentication
Users need to log in or register to see the contact information of pet owners and to create pet posts.

## Post-a-Pet
The "Post a Pet" feature allows users to create detailed listings for their pets. Pet owners fill out a form with comprehensive information about their pets and can upload a picture that will be featured in the post.

## Profile
Profile pages contain contact information to ensure effective communication between interested adopters and pet owners. Users can view, edit, or delete their profiles to keep information up to date for effective communication.
